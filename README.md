# CompositeGAN_WhistleAugment

This is the repository of our paper "Learning Stage-wise GANs
 for Whistle Extraction in Time-Frequency Spectrograms" 
 published on IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (2023/3/1). 
 
## DeepWhistle model
The codes for generating training data and whistle 
extraction model training and evaluation are provided 
in our previous repository of [DeepWhistle](https://github.com/Paul-LiPu/DeepWhistle).
 
## Stage-wise GAN
#### WGANs for generating background noises and whistle contours


#### CycleGAN for generating whistles on background noise
